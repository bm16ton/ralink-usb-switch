Flipshare was some camcorder with a tv set top box addon that allowed streaming from the camera. The wifi adapter it used started in usb mass storage/hid and maybe another interface. USB switch I could never get to work, probly cuz it starts on wrong interface, they dont support hid, tho not sure hid is used to switch at all. So I wrote this to switch it to a dual band ralink wifi. use build.sh to build.
